### Python things I make. 

---

## network-share.py
Easily add SMB shares to `/etc/fstab`.

## hostname.py
Change a device's hostname via the command line, no need to edit any files yourself. 

## zoidberg.py
This was the first Python thing I ever made. Basically a glorified "hello world" that prints Zoidberg's face.
