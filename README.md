# scripts
Useful scripts for automating things I do often enough that they require a script to automate them Edit

## network-share.py
Easily add SMB shares to `/etc/fstab`.

## hostname.py
Change a device's hostname via the command line, no need to edit any files yourself. 

## zoidberg.py
This was the first Python thing I ever made. Basically a glorified "hello world" that prints Zoidberg's face.
