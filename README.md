# Python-Scripts
#### Random small Python things. Most of them probably suck, but at least they work (to some degree).

## NW-Share-fstab.py
Adds CIFS network shares (and older SMB shares too, I think) to the fstab file to mount permanently.  
This can be done manually rather quickly, but I'm lazy and enjoy making things.

## zoidberg.py
This was the first Python thing I ever made. Basically a glorified "hello world" that prints Zoidberg's face.
